## Introduction
This is a power BI project on restaurants analysis based on consumers' rating.

The aim of the project is to analyze and drive insight to answer crucial questions which will help furture investors make data driven decisions.

**_Disclaimer_**: _All dataset and report do not represent any company, institution or country, but just a dummy dataset to demonstrate capabilities of Power BI._

## Problem Statement

1. What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on ratings? 
2. What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample? 
3. Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?
4. If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?

## Skills and Concepts demostrated

The following power BI features were incorporated:
- Power query
- DAX
- Modelling
- Visualization

## Data Transformation and cleaning
Merged tables, first roll as header, find and replace, added conditional column (demorgraphic), changed data type

## Data Modelling
Automatically derived relationships were adjusted and replaced with the required relationship.

There are 2 dimension and 1 fact tables and the dimension tables were joined to the fact table using the one-to-many relationship.

## Data Visualization and Analysis

The top overall rated restaurant, Tortas Locas Hipocampo offers Mexican fast food, medium priced and in a closed location. The food rating and in turn overall rating could be said to have been influenced by consumersâ€™ preference since most consumers prefer Mexican cuisine, and have medium budget.

The consumers are mainly single, young adults representing 87.27% of the dataset. 

## Conclusion/Recommendation

An investor should look out for the following characteristics: medium to low price restaurant, closed area, preferably offering fast food, cafeteria and/or bar.

I believe that the need for bar has not been fully maximized. Since the cities are dominated by young single adults, a restaurant offering bar together with fast food will be a great investment
